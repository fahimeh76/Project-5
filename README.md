In this project, the goal is to develop a mobile application using Kivy. 
Features & Requirements: 
1- User Registration: 
• When the user opens the app, they are presented with a registration page. 
• The page includes two fields: Username and Password. 
• After registration, the user credentials (username/password) are stored in a JSON 
file for authentication during login. 
2- User Login: 
• If the user is already registered, they can click the "Login" button to open the login 
page. 
• The user enters their username and password to log in. 
• If the credentials are incorrect, an error message is displayed. 
• If the credentials are correct, the user is redirected to the app dashboard. 
3- Logout Functionality: 
• After logging in, the user can click the "Logout" button to log out of the app. 
• Upon logout, the user is redirected back to the login page. 
4- Search Feature in the Dashboard: 
• Once logged in, the dashboard contains a search field. 
• The user can type part of a country's name in the search box. 
• Upon clicking the "Search" button, the app fetches matching results from a file 
named countries.txt. 
• The relevant country names are displayed below the search button.
